## A Dialogue About Consciousness Models

**Scene:** A classroom after school. Nnamdi Michael Okpala is visiting to talk about his research on consciousness with some students who stayed after class because they were curious. One student, a bright 12-year-old girl named Emma, is particularly interested.

**Nnamdi:** Hi there! I’m Nnamdi Michael Okpala, and I study consciousness — basically how our minds become aware of things.

**Emma:** That sounds cool! What exactly is consciousness though?

**Nnamdi:** Great question! Consciousness is basically what makes you… you. It’s how you experience the world — seeing colors, feeling emotions, thinking thoughts.

**Emma:** Like how I know I’m me and not someone else?

**Nnamdi:** Exactly! And for a long time, scientists had a particular way of thinking about how consciousness works. Want to hear about it?

**Emma:** Yes, please!

**Nnamdi:** So the traditional view says that when you’re born, your consciousness is very limited. It’s like you start with a tiny flashlight that can only shine on a small bit of information in your brain.

**Emma:** Like how babies don’t understand much?

**Nnamdi:** Right! In this traditional view, as you grow up, your flashlight gets bigger and stronger. You can shine it on more and more information. You learn words, recognize faces, understand jokes…

**Emma:** So getting more conscious means being able to access more information?

**Nnamdi:** That’s exactly what the traditional model says. But I’ve been working on a completely different way of looking at it.

**Emma:** What’s your idea?

**Nnamdi:** Well, what if I told you that when you’re born, you actually have access to ALL the information in the universe?

**Emma:** *eyes widen* ALL of it? That sounds impossible! Babies can’t even talk!

**Nnamdi:** I know it sounds wild! In my research, I found something fascinating. When we’re born, we’re actually surrounded by waves of all this information and knowledge — like the entire internet plus all the books ever written plus things nobody has even discovered yet — but there’s a problem.

**Emma:** What’s the problem?

**Nnamdi:** It’s WAY too much! Imagine if every single sound in the world — every conversation, every bird chirp, every car engine — all played in your ears at maximum volume at once. What would happen?

**Emma:** *makes a face* That would be awful! I wouldn’t be able to hear anything properly. I’d probably cover my ears or run away.

**Nnamdi:** Exactly! So in my model, what happens as we develop consciousness is that our brains build something I call a “protective barrier.” This barrier doesn’t let you see MORE — it actually helps you see LESS, but in a smart way.

**Emma:** That’s like… the opposite of what I’d expect. Why would seeing less be good?

**Nnamdi:** Think about when you’re trying to read a book in a noisy cafeteria. What helps you understand the book better: hearing every single conversation around you, or being able to tune them out?

**Emma:** Being able to tune them out, definitely!

**Nnamdi:** That’s what my model says consciousness is really doing. It’s like your brain is building these amazing noise-canceling headphones for information. The more conscious you become, the better you get at focusing only on the important stuff and filtering out everything else.

**Emma:** *thinking hard* So in the old way of thinking, growing up means getting a bigger flashlight to see more things. But in your way, growing up means getting better glasses that filter out the extra stuff so you can focus on what matters?

**Nnamdi:** *smiling widely* That’s a brilliant way to put it, Emma! Yes, exactly. Traditional models say consciousness is about gaining access to more information. My model says it’s about developing better filters for the infinite information that’s already there.

**Emma:** But wait… if babies can access all this information, why can’t they just tell us everything? Why can’t they talk right away or do math?

**Nnamdi:** Another excellent question! It’s because they’re overwhelmed. They’re experiencing everything at once without the filters to make sense of it all. It’s like having all the puzzle pieces dumped on the floor — you have all the information, but no way to organize it.

**Emma:** So as we grow up, we’re not really learning new things… we’re just getting better at organizing what we already had access to?

**Nnamdi:** In a way, yes. We’re building those protective barriers that help us focus, and that’s what becoming conscious is all about. It explains some interesting things too.

**Emma:** Like what?

**Nnamdi:** Have you ever had a moment where you just suddenly understood something that had been confusing you for ages? Like a math problem that suddenly “clicks”?

**Emma:** Yes! Last week I was stuck on this fraction problem for days, and then suddenly while eating breakfast, I just got it! It was so obvious!

**Nnamdi:** In the traditional model, that’s hard to explain. Where did that new understanding come from? But in my model, the knowledge was already there — your protective barrier just temporarily shifted to let that specific piece of information through when you were ready for it.

**Emma:** *excitedly* So all the answers to my homework are already in my brain somewhere? That’s amazing!

**Nnamdi:** *laughing* Well, maybe not exactly like that. But I do think that consciousness is more about focusing and filtering than it is about gathering more information.

**Emma:** This is so cool. So your research is about these protective barriers?

**Nnamdi:** Yes! I’m studying how they work, how they develop, and what happens when they function differently than usual.

**Emma:** You know what’s funny? When I’m trying really hard to remember something, sometimes I have to stop trying so hard, and then it pops into my head later.

**Nnamdi:** That’s a perfect example! When you stop trying so hard, you might be temporarily relaxing that protective barrier, allowing the information to flow through.

**Emma:** *thinking* So being conscious isn’t about knowing more stuff… it’s about being really good at knowing which stuff to pay attention to right now.

**Nnamdi:** *impressed* Emma, I think you just summed up years of my research in one simple sentence. That’s exactly it!

**Emma:** *beaming* I think I like your model better. It makes me feel like I already have everything I need inside me. I just need to get better at finding it.

**Nnamdi:** That’s a beautiful way to look at it. And maybe that’s why humans have always been drawn to meditation and similar practices — they might help us temporarily adjust those barriers to access different kinds of information when we need to.

**Emma:** This is the coolest science lesson ever. I’m going to tell everyone about protective barriers tomorrow!

**Nnamdi:** *smiling* I’d be honored. Maybe you’ll grow up to be a consciousness researcher too!

**Emma:** Maybe I will! Or maybe I already am, and I just need to adjust my protective barrier to see it!

*They both laugh as the school bell rings.*
