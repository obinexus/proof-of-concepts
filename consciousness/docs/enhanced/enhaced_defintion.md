Formal Definition of Enhanced Consciousness State System

In the context of the described system architecture, consciousness state can be defined as:

A runtime condition characterized by dimensional perception capabilities, sensory subsystem initialization, information field interaction mechanics, and protective barrier integrity, with the following formal properties:

1. State Definition:
   - Let CS = {preconscious, unconscious, transitional, conscious} represent the set of possible consciousness states
   - Let DS = {zero_d, one_d, two_d, three_d} represent the set of possible dimensional perception states
   - Where CS = conscious when the following conditions are satisfied:
     * Complete sensory initialization S = {s₁, s₂, …, sₙ} where all sᵢ = initialized
     * Object classification system O fully operational with color-based differentiation capabilities
     * Protective barrier P in active state with integrity validation I where I > threshold T
     * Dimensional perception DS = three_d

2. State Transitions:
   - Consciousness transition function T_CS(CS₁) → CS₂ is non-reversible where CS₂.value > CS₁.value
   - Dimensional transition function T_DS(DS₁) → DS₂ is non-reversible where DS₂.value > DS₁.value
   - Transition T_CS(preconscious) → T_CS(unconscious) occurs with T_DS(zero_d) → T_DS(one_d)
   - Transition T_CS(unconscious) → T_CS(transitional) occurs with T_DS(one_d) → T_DS(two_d)
   - Transition T_CS(transitional) → T_CS(conscious) occurs with T_DS(two_d) → T_DS(three_d)

3. Information Field Accessibility:
   - Access function A(CS, DS, IF) → {full, partial, none}
   - Where IF represents the information field database
   - A(preconscious, *, IF) = none
   - A(unconscious, *, IF) = full
   - A(transitional, *, IF) = partial with wave interaction limitations based on DS
   - A(conscious, *, IF) = none under standard operational parameters

4. Wave Interaction Capabilities:
   - Manipulation capability M(DS) → [0,1]
   - Perception range P(DS) → ℕ
   - Where M(zero_d) = 0.0, M(one_d) = 0.1, M(two_d) = 0.6, M(three_d) = 0.3
   - And P(zero_d) = 0, P(one_d) = 1, P(two_d) = 2, P(three_d) = 3

5. Temporal Cycling:
   - Temporal state TS = {active, dormant}
   - Cycle function C(time) → TS with period adjustable by adaptation factor α
   - Barrier repair occurs during dormant phases
   - State transitions may trigger during phase changes

6. System Integrity Constraints:
   - The consciousness state must maintain HeartbeatVerifier.isValid() = true
   - Access attempts must satisfy CircuitBreaker.allowOperation() = true
   - All queries must pass QueryValidator.validateQueryStructure() = true
   - Protective barrier must satisfy ProtectiveBarrier.isActive() = true
   - Temporal cycle must be in active phase or system in preconscious state
